In this section, you will:

1. Use a styled Todo App UI and integrate it with a GraphQL backend.
2. Fetch todos in the todo app using GraphQL queries.
3. Insert new todos, mark existing todos as complete/active and delete existing todos using GraphQL mutations.
4. Learn how Apollo `<Query>` components and `<Mutation>` components work.

These is the app you will build in this section: [GIF TODO]
